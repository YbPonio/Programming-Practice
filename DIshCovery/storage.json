    "description": "Forget chicken: This sweet and spicy vegetarian dish proves once more that cauliflower is king. Originally from Sichuan province but popular in other parts of China, as well as in Chinese-American restaurants, kung pao chicken is traditionally a stir-fry. Here, the cauliflower is deep-fried for a light and crispy texture that pairs perfectly with the dish’s signature chiles and peanuts.",

    "name": "Beans Bourguignon",
    "description": "This vegan recipe is a wonderful alternative to classic beef bourguignon (and is fast, too). Dried porcinis are soaked to create a flavorful, earthy broth. Next, meaty mushrooms are browned to perfection, then added to a rich wine sauce along with carrots and the star of the show, cannellini beans, which soak up all the flavors as they simmer and naturally thicken the sauce so you can skip the usual flour. Served over herbed pasta, this dish is ideal for chilly nights when you crave a satisfying and cozy stick-to-your-ribs stew.",

Serve the beans bourguignon on top of the herbed pasta and garnish with more parsley if desired."
